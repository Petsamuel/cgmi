                        <strong> By: Archbishop M E Benson Idahosa <br>
<p> TUESDAY AUGUST 11 <br>
    You Have Access to God and to His Power and Promises <br>
    John 16:26-27 (NLT ) , John 14:12 ( LB ), 2 Corinthians 1:20 (NIV) <br></p></strong>
    Then you will ask in my name.  I'm not saying I will ask the Father on your behalf,
     for the Father himself loves you dearly because you love me and believe that  I came from God. <br>
    <strong>"... I tell you, anyone believing  in me shall do the same miracles  I have done , and even greater ones , because I am going to be with the Father. <strong>
    For no matter how many promises God has made , they are "Yes" in Christ. 
    And so through him  the  "Amen" is spoken by us to the  glory of God.</strong></p><p>

    One of the privileges  you enjoy as a believer is that  you have direct access to God the Father. 
    Ephesians  2:18  says, "For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father." 
    Christ is one with God and you are in Christ.  This means that you are in God. 
    The Bible says you are dead and your life is hid in Christ in God, Colossians 3:3. 
    Because you are in Christ, you are always in God's presence. <br>
    Because you are always in God's presence, you can boldly talk directly with  God and receive His mercy and grace anytime you want and anywhere you are, Hebrews 4:16.
     You do not need  any human intermediary. There is no man or woman that gives you access to God or that has more access to God than you. 
     Jesus has given you the very same access to God that He has and  He has also  given  you His authority. 
     This is why you can pray with boldness and expect the same answers and results that Jesus Himself will get. 
     In John 17:22 , Jesus said He has given us His glory  and in verse 23, He said that  God the Father loves us  just the same way He loves Him. 
     It is not something we achieved on our own. God  gave us this right and privilege through Christ. 
     So we do not boast in ourselves or in any man or woman, we boast in Christ. </p><p>
        By His Spirit, Christ has also given us access to His  very same power and ability , Acts 1:8. 
        We can now represent Him and function like Him in every single way. 
        This is why Apostle Paul said, "I can do all things through Christ  that strengthens me,"  Philippians 4:13 . 
        He was also very confident of God's  provision for all his needs, Philippians 4:19. Nothing is impossible for you. 
        Because of Jesus, you also have a right to ALL the promises of God. They are already your reality. 
        As you accept and declare them as your reality, you will experience their manifestation in your life. <br>
<strong style="font-size: 17px;"> â€•Prayer: </strong><br>
I thank you  Dear Father , for the great love you have for me and for the access you have given me to your presence, power and promises.

                   <h5>SUNDAY SCHOOL LESSON</h5>
                  <strong>DATE: SUNDAY  AUGUST 09, 2020 
                        TOPIC: THE BELIVERS' CONDUCT 
TEXT: TITUS 2:1-15
CENTRAL THOUGHT :
Grace projects and promotes Godliness, right living and Good work.</strong><br><p>
INTRODUCTION:
In today's world, there seems to be a silent resentment between the aged and the young ones of the society as a
result of conflict of ideas. The church has not been immune to this because there are
tendencies that portray the young as being in hurry to do away with the old school and to carve a niche for themselves.
Having people of
different ages and means in church is supposed to make
the church strong, balanced and complete. However, there
are imminent challenges here and there. The role of an efficient leadership is to harness Such diversities to the
advantage of the church.</p><p>
Grace is the common
denominator for salvation among all believers. It is open
to all, and all are invited to partake of her benefits. To
love and live in sin is to
trample under foot the works
of grace perfected by the
blood of Jesus Christ.
Salvation through grace
should be the beginning of practical demonstration of God's nature by any believer.
In this study, we shall
explain the nature and purpose of God's grace, and how it should motivate in us a life of
service and obedience to God. </p>
