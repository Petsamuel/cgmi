					In this new month, evil will not visit you.
					The devil will not visit you. Angels of God will visit you with good news.
					Whatever you have been waiting for, for years, this month it shall locate you. 
					Suddenly you will receive a strange alert. People will remember you to honour you in the mighty name of Jesus. Amen. <br>
					Isaiah 46:10 <br>
				• The devil does not have the final say, God is in the habit of declaring the end from the beginning. Nothing takes Him unawares. <br>
				• God sees and provides ahead. 
					Psalm 37:19
					Genesis 47:27 <br>
				• Difficulties are part of humanity, but in the midst of them, God has provided abundance for His people.
				Joseph triumphed in the midst of famine in Egypt. <br>
				• Famine is only on the earth and not in heaven. <br>
				• We are sitted together with Jesus in heavenly places and there is no famine there. <br>
				• We are in this world, but not of this world. The famine can hit the world, but we are exempted. 
				I pray for you; you will continue to enjoy the miracle of exemption. <br>
				• In Egypt, people were offering themselves for sale and auctioning their properties because of the famine, but the covenant people triumphed gloriously.
				I pray for someone, you will take over this season! <br>
				• The people of God in the same environment with the Egyptians enjoyed supernatural prosperity. <br>
				• This season you will multiply. <br>
				• God mysteriously altered the climatic condition in Egypt to favour His children. <br>

				I pray for someone here, you are in this world, but not of this world; This season, you will have possessions. <br>
				 This season you will buy up what they are not able to manage and handle.
				</div>
					
					<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-4 col-lg-4 bg-light">
						• All those things they've stolen, and hidden, you will take over! <br>
						• The covenant people will shine <br>
						• This pandemic era, it is for the Glory of God to be demonstrated. Arise, shine for your light is come! <br>
						• This month, you will shine. <br>
						• This month, you will demonstrate the greatness and Glory of God. 
						The Lord has shown us how to triumph in the midst of it all; Matthew 6:9-13 <br>
						• The Lord's prayer is a prayer and life pattern. <br>
						• In order to go through any season, there must be revival, survival and deliverance from evil. <br>
						• If you break the sequence of the Lord's prayer, then you have evil to contend with. Matthew 6:10,33 <br>
						• Revival means seeking the will of God, putting God and the expansion of His kingdom first. <br>
						• Revival simply means return to Obedience. <br>
						• If you are outside the will of God, you are outside revival. Return to God to ensure survival
						Survival is having everything you need to survive in this world.
						Matthew 6: 11 <br>
						• As you go about to ensure your revival, then your survival in God is sure.
						1st Kings 17:13-15 <br>
						• God sent Elijah to a poor widowed woman because it was the woman that needed help, not Elihah. <br>
						• If you are going to survive, the law is God first- revival. <br>
						• Anytime you disobey God, you make God handicapped from blessing you.(Rev. Faithful Ndeti). <br>
						• The way to survival is revival. Return to Jesus, the house of God, the will of God and your survival is sure. <br>
					</div>
						<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 bg-light">
						 <h5 class="text-center">Prayers</h5> 
						• Father, deliver me from evil of misplaced priority. Whatever is making me to pursue my survival first, Lord deliver me. <br>
						• Lord Jesus, I hand my life into your hand for safety, security and satisfaction.
						Isaiah 41:10. <br>
						• I pray for you, in this month of August, as you pursue God, He will pursue your needs. As you go after God, He will ho after your own.
						• I pray for you, this month, there will be revival in your spiritual life, your house and the house of God. <br>
						• I pray for you, what is about to finish because of this season, as you come back to God, He will multiply it. <br>
						
						I prophecy over your life, as you have done your Thanksgiving; resources from where your income came from will not go dry. Your job will not be lost, your business will not go down. Favour will come your way.
						
						# I bless you with favour from on high. I prophecy over your life, before the end of this month, you will have testimonies of all round revival, all round rest, all round peace, all round Grace. You will not struggle, you will not fail. I speak to your life, I command abundance to come your way. Receive the favour of God. This month of August, you will be visited by heaven in the mighty name of Jesus. 
						I bless you. I decree over your life: Father for all you have given me, I will loose none. No lion will carry my sheep! So shall it be in the mighty name of Jesus. Amen#

				<strong>I looked for someone among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have to destroy it, but I found no one. 
				Then I heard the Lord say "Whom shall I send? Who will be our messenger?" I answered, " I will go! Send me!" *And He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no Intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and His righteousness, it sustained Him. 
				Then said Jesus... Peace be unto you: as my Father has sent me even so send I you.</strong>

							The only way God can move or do anything on this earth , is through the help of a human being. 
							The same applies to the devil. The reason for this is that God has put man in charge of what happens on earth,  Psalms 115:16. 
							Now, the only way that God can move or do anything through anyone is when that person willingly accept to yield to God and allow God move or flow through him or her. God's original intention was for man to be connected to Him so that there will be an agreement between what happens in Heaven and what happens on earth. 
						 <br>
						  <p>This plan was altered when Adam and Eve sinned and fell short of God's glory. 
						 They were disconnected from the life of God and there was a gap between what goes on in Heaven and what goes on in the earth. 
						 Death ( all evil ) began to reign over man and the earth, ( Romans 5:17a ) but God then sent Jesus to come down as a man to both relate with man effectively as well as die to rescue man from the power of the devil,  Hebrews 2 :14-15. 
						 Jesus functioned on this earth as a human being. He slept, He ate, He was tired, He was tempted and He had to pray and yield Himself to God so He could do His will. God has now made us one with Jesus  ( 1 John 4:17 ,  1 Corinthians 6:17 ). 
						  We are the body of Christ, Ephesians 1:22-23. We are the flesh and bones of Jesus, Ephesians 5:30. You are His Ambassador, He wants to reconcile men, and situations back to Himself through you,  2 Corinthians 5:7-19.  God has anointed you just as He anointed Jesus, that is why Jesus has sent you into the world just as the Father sent Him. Right now , God needs you desperately. 
						 He can not move and touch the lives of people without you. You are His eyes, mouth, hands, feet and heart. God wants you to be as passionate as Jesus in yielding yourself to Him  ( Luke 22:42 ) just as Jesus was ( John 9:4, John 4:34 ).</p>
							<h3>Prayer :</h3>

							I yield myself to you dear Lord. Come and save , touch and bless the lives of others through me today. 
							Use me to pray , give, preach and bless others.</p>
