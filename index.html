					In this new month, evil will not visit you.
					The devil will not visit you. Angels of God will visit you with good news.
					Whatever you have been waiting for, for years, this month it shall locate you. 
					Suddenly you will receive a strange alert. People will remember you to honour you in the mighty name of Jesus. Amen. <br>
					Isaiah 46:10 <br>
				• The devil does not have the final say, God is in the habit of declaring the end from the beginning. Nothing takes Him unawares. <br>
				• God sees and provides ahead. 
					Psalm 37:19
					Genesis 47:27 <br>
				• Difficulties are part of humanity, but in the midst of them, God has provided abundance for His people.
				Joseph triumphed in the midst of famine in Egypt. <br>
				• Famine is only on the earth and not in heaven. <br>
				• We are sitted together with Jesus in heavenly places and there is no famine there. <br>
				• We are in this world, but not of this world. The famine can hit the world, but we are exempted. 
				I pray for you; you will continue to enjoy the miracle of exemption. <br>
				• In Egypt, people were offering themselves for sale and auctioning their properties because of the famine, but the covenant people triumphed gloriously.
				I pray for someone, you will take over this season! <br>
				• The people of God in the same environment with the Egyptians enjoyed supernatural prosperity. <br>
				• This season you will multiply. <br>
				• God mysteriously altered the climatic condition in Egypt to favour His children. <br>

				I pray for someone here, you are in this world, but not of this world; This season, you will have possessions. <br>
				 This season you will buy up what they are not able to manage and handle.
				</div>
					
					<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-4 col-lg-4 bg-light">
						• All those things they've stolen, and hidden, you will take over! <br>
						• The covenant people will shine <br>
						• This pandemic era, it is for the Glory of God to be demonstrated. Arise, shine for your light is come! <br>
						• This month, you will shine. <br>
						• This month, you will demonstrate the greatness and Glory of God. 
						The Lord has shown us how to triumph in the midst of it all; Matthew 6:9-13 <br>
						• The Lord's prayer is a prayer and life pattern. <br>
						• In order to go through any season, there must be revival, survival and deliverance from evil. <br>
						• If you break the sequence of the Lord's prayer, then you have evil to contend with. Matthew 6:10,33 <br>
						• Revival means seeking the will of God, putting God and the expansion of His kingdom first. <br>
						• Revival simply means return to Obedience. <br>
						• If you are outside the will of God, you are outside revival. Return to God to ensure survival
						Survival is having everything you need to survive in this world.
						Matthew 6: 11 <br>
						• As you go about to ensure your revival, then your survival in God is sure.
						1st Kings 17:13-15 <br>
						• God sent Elijah to a poor widowed woman because it was the woman that needed help, not Elihah. <br>
						• If you are going to survive, the law is God first- revival. <br>
						• Anytime you disobey God, you make God handicapped from blessing you.(Rev. Faithful Ndeti). <br>
						• The way to survival is revival. Return to Jesus, the house of God, the will of God and your survival is sure. <br>
					</div>
						<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 bg-light">
						 <h5 class="text-center">Prayers</h5> 
						• Father, deliver me from evil of misplaced priority. Whatever is making me to pursue my survival first, Lord deliver me. <br>
						• Lord Jesus, I hand my life into your hand for safety, security and satisfaction.
						Isaiah 41:10. <br>
						• I pray for you, in this month of August, as you pursue God, He will pursue your needs. As you go after God, He will ho after your own.
						• I pray for you, this month, there will be revival in your spiritual life, your house and the house of God. <br>
						• I pray for you, what is about to finish because of this season, as you come back to God, He will multiply it. <br>
						
						I prophecy over your life, as you have done your Thanksgiving; resources from where your income came from will not go dry. Your job will not be lost, your business will not go down. Favour will come your way.
						
						# I bless you with favour from on high. I prophecy over your life, before the end of this month, you will have testimonies of all round revival, all round rest, all round peace, all round Grace. You will not struggle, you will not fail. I speak to your life, I command abundance to come your way. Receive the favour of God. This month of August, you will be visited by heaven in the mighty name of Jesus. 
						I bless you. I decree over your life: Father for all you have given me, I will loose none. No lion will carry my sheep! So shall it be in the mighty name of Jesus. Amen#

					Monday August 03 <br>	
					You Shall Enter into the Joy of the Lord <br>	
					<i>Matthew 25:20-21, Hebrews 12::2</i>
					</span>
				
			<br>
			<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
						And so he that had received five talents came  .... saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. His Lord said unto him , Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 
						<b>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God</b> .
						In our society today, we shall consider  what the joy of the Lord is from two different angles. In Zephaniah 3:7 , the Bible says that God is rejoicing over you with singing. Someone may want to ask the question --- but why is God rejoicing over me? One of the reasons why God is rejoicing over you is because of what He sees and knows about your life . 
						He sees what your life is and what is going to become because of what Jesus has done for you.  This is what Jesus was also seeing that made Him endure the cross and despise the shame of His suffering and death for you. The glory of God is upon your life and there are much greater dimensions of God's  glory that you are going to enter into, Colossians 1:27.
						As you keep your focus on the glory of Jesus, the Holy Spirit will continue to transform you from glory to glory into His image , 2 Corinthians 3:18.
						</div> 
						<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
						Another dimension of the joy of the Lord is the blessings and rewards for our obedience to God and our productivity and fruitfulness. When our first text above says,  'enter into the joy of thy Lord' it is referring to the rewards that  the master had prepared to give  to his servant for the servant's obedience, productivity and fruitfulness. 
						God also has great blessings and rewards prepared for us as we continually focus on Christ and remain productive and fruitful . Isaiah 1:19 says, "If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land." Child of God, you are not wasting your time by obeying God and doing His will. 
						You are not wasting your time  by multiplying, increasing, adding value and making the most of what you have been given by God. Never lose sight  of the great blessings and rewards ahead of you. Jesus is joyfully looking forward to giving you these blessings and rewards, Revelation 22:12.
						<h5>Prayer :</h5>br
						I rejoice and thank You Heavenly Father for your great joy , your glory and your blessings and rewards  that you have prepared for me to experience.
						 "Since you are precious and honoured in my sight, and because I love you, I will give people in exchange for you, nations in exchange for your life".(Isaiah 43:4). 
						I pray for you and your family that 
						As a matter of urgency, those wishing you dead shall die in your place.
						Anyone talking and does not want you to talk shall go dumb.
						Everyone using evil power to humiliate you shall experience irreparable loss of such power. 
						I pray that the God Heaven shall cloth you with garment of honour and turn your austerity to prosperity, in Jesus name. Shallom!</p>
